File handling is needed for any application. For some tasks to be done file needs to be processed. File handling in PHP is similar as file handling is done by using any programming language like C. PHP has many functions to work with normal files.
Files can be opened in any of the following modes :
“w” – Opens a file for write only. If file not exist then new file is created and if file already exists then contents of file is erased.
“r” – File is opened for read only.
“a” – File is opened for write only. File pointer points to end of file. Existing data in file is preserved.
“w+” – Opens file for read and write. If file not exist then new file is created and if file already exists then contents of file is erased.
“r+” – File is opened for read/write.
“a+” – File is opened for write/read. File pointer points to end of file. Existing data in file is preserved. If file is not there then new file is created.
“x” – New file is created for write only.
